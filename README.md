#📊 Profit Insights Dashboard

This project is a beginner-focused Excel dashboard that analyzes *Revenue*, *Cost*, and *Profit* trends across different products, customer segments, and countries.

---

🔍 Overview

The *Profit Insights Dashboard* helps visualize:

- *Monthly Revenue vs Cost* trends  
- *Top Products by Average Profit*  
- *Average Profit by Country*  
- *Total Revenue and Total Cost KPIs*

It includes interactive filters using *data validation (manual dropdowns)* for:
- Product Name
- Customer Segment
- Country

> ⚠️ *Note:*  
> The *Product Name* column contained multiple products listed *within a single cell* (e.g., 2–3 product names per entry).  
> Extracting and analyzing them individually required complex formulas and creative structuring to enable filtering and accurate calculations.
