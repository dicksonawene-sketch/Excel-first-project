# 📊 Profit Insights Dashboard

This project is a beginner-focused Excel dashboard that analyzes *Revenue*, *Cost*, and *Profit* trends across different products, customer segments, and countries.

---

🔍 Overview

The *Profit Insights Dashboard* helps visualize:

- *Monthly Revenue vs Cost* trends  
- *Top Products by Average Profit*  
- *Average Profit by Country*  
- *Total Revenue and Total Cost KPIs*

It includes interactive filters using *data validation (manual dropdowns)* for:
- Product Name
- Customer Segment
- Country

> ⚠️ *Note:*  
> The *Product Name* column, which is part of my Interactive Filters, contains cells listing 3 to 5 products per cell.  
> This required the use of complex Excel functions to manage dynamic filtering and calculations, making the process quite challenging.
